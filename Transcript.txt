User: Wwhat is the current error in my BST insert?

AI: Looking at your BST insert method, there's a logical error in the comparison condition. Currently you have:

if (root.getData().compareTo(e) >= 0)
    root.setLeft(insertHelp(root.getLeft(), e));
The issue is with the >= 0 condition. In a proper BST:

	•  Values less than the current node should go to the left
	•  Values greater than the current node should go to the right
	•  Equal values should typically go to the left (or right, but be consistent)

Your current logic puts values that are greater than or equal to the current node on the left, which is backwards.

Here's the corrected version:
private BinaryNode<T> insertHelp(BinaryNode<T> root, T e) {
    if (root == null)
        return new BinaryNode<T>(e);
    if (e.compareTo(root.getData()) <= 0)
        root.setLeft(insertHelp(root.getLeft(), e));
    else
        root.setRight(insertHelp(root.getRight(), e));
    return root;
}

The key changes:

	1. Compare e.compareTo(root.getData()) instead of root.getData().compareTo(e)
	2. Use <= 0 to put smaller/equal values on the left
	3. Put larger values on the right

This ensures your BST maintains the proper ordering property where left subtree contains smaller values and right subtree contains larger values.
